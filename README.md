## Usage

To use this plugin, add [`paginated_items_builder`](https://pub.dev/packages/paginated_items_builder) as a dependency in your pubspec.yaml file.

```yaml
  dependencies:
    flutter:
      sdk: flutter
    paginated_items_builder:
```

First and foremost, import the widget.
```dart
import 'package:paginated_items_builder/paginated_items_builder.dart';
```

You can now add an [`PaginatedItemsBuilder`](https://github.com/rithik-dev/paginated_items_builder/blob/master/lib/paginated_items_builder.dart) widget to your widget tree and pass the child as the only required parameter to get started.
```dart
PaginatedItemsBuilder(
),
```

See the [`example`](https://github.com/rithik-dev/paginated_items_builder/blob/master/example) directory for a complete sample app.
